We generated a model similar to that used in \cite{Fiete} in an attempt to replicate the results from the paper. Our model did not work with the parameters provided by the paper, but we were able to generate a working IB model. In addition, while we did not see the synchronous regular firing observed in \cite{Fiete}, we were able to show partial convergence of weight matrices to scaled permutation matrices and limited synfiring chain behavior. We were also able to replicate these partial results with Hebbian learning instead of STDP learning. While our model had a number of minor flaws, it provided a nice start to verifying and testing the assertions of \cite{Fiete}.
