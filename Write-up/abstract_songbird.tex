Sequential cognitive processing are driven by sequences of neural activity in various parts of the brain. 
Hahnloser \textit{et al.} claim that the combination of heterosynpatic competition within single neurons and spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) lead the network to sequential activity. In this paper, we will re-examine their claim by investigating the effect of hLTP and the necessity of  STDP.
