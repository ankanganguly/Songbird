Sequential cognitive processing are driven by sequences of neural activity in various parts of the brain. 
Hahnloser \textit{et al.} claim that the combination of heterosynaptic competition within single neurons and spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) lead the network to sequential activity. In this paper, we will re-examine their claim by investigating the effect of heterosynaptic competition and the necessity of STDP. We build a model which partially replicates the results of \cite{Fiete}, and demonstrate that these partial properties remain when we replace STDP by Hebbian learning.
